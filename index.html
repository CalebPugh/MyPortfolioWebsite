        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, I’m Caleb Pugh, a junior at UT Austin studying Economics with a Philosophy minor and a certificate in Elements of Computing. I’m on a mission to break into product management and build things that really matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve always been interested in tech, but what fascinates me more is the why—not just how it works, but how it impacts people’s lives. At my last internship, I got hands-on experience in shaping products that people actually use, and it opened my eyes to how much thought goes into creating an amazing product.

        <h2>Currently Building</h2>

        <p>
          I'm building Wedge, a weekly newsletter designed to help college students land internships in tech. Having navigated the challenges myself, I know how tough it can be to break into the tech world. Wedge will provide actionable tips, resources, and weekly tech internship opportunities across roles like product management and software development. Beyond being a resource, I want Wedge to be a community where students can connect, learn, and grow together as they pursue their tech careers
        </p>

        <h2>Involvement</h2>

        <p>
          I’m involved in various extracurricular activities, including the Business Analytics Association (BAXA), Technology Consulting Group (TCG), and Pi Kappa Alpha.
